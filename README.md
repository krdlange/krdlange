# Hi, I am Kriska! 👧🏻🇵🇭👋🏼    

I am a recent Full-stack Web Development bootcamp graduate with experience and background in Marketing and UX/UI design. I am eager to expand my skills in front-end development and work on challenging projects that showcase my creativity and technical abilities. 

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have a working knowledge of modern front-end frameworks such as React and Vue as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, RestAPI, and MySQL. I am highly motivated and detail-oriented, passionate about creating intuitive and user-friendly web applications.
